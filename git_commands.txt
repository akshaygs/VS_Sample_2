git --version       will get git version

Configure git
This is important for version control systems, as each Git commit uses this information:
Use global to set the username and e-mail for every repository on your computer.
If you want to set the username/e-mail for just the current repo, you can remove global

git config --global user.name "akshaygs"
git config --global user.email "akshaygs2013@gmail.com"


Initialize GIT

You just created your first Git Repository!
git init 
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/user/myproject/.git/

git status          status of the repo
git status --short / git status -s  short form descrption of status

git repo folder can be of 2 states tracked/untracked

When you first add files to a repo they are untracked, 
To get GIT to track them you need to stage them or add them to staging environment

GIT STAGIGING

git add readme.md       adds readme.md to staging environment
git add --all / git add -A           adds all files to staging environment

GIT commit

git commit -m "First release"       commits the added files with message

To add and commit the changes in the same line
git commit -a -m "Updated index.html with a new line"

-a automatically stage any modified and deleted files before commiting


git help --all
git command -help

GIT Branche

git branch              display the branches and current branch
git branch v2           creates new branch
git chekcout v2         makes the branch v2 as current branch

These are some changes made in v2

GIT (this bracket is added here) MERGE

git chekcout master     make master current branch
git merge v2            from the master branch changes in v2 are taken into master
git branch -d v2        deletes v2 branch

This is in master
